Plotting an averaged ASD with percentiles.
##########################################

As we have seen in :ref:`pydischarge-example-frequencyseries-hoff`, the Amplitude
Spectral Density (ASD) is a key indicator of frequency-domain sensitivity for
a gravitational-wave detector.

However, the ASD doesn't allow you to see how much the sensitivity varies
over time.
One tool for that is the :ref:`spectrogram <pydischarge-spectrogram>`, while another
is simply to show percentiles of a number of ASD measurements.

In this example we calculate the median ASD over 2048-seconds surrounding
the GW178017 event, and also the 5th and 95th percentiles of the ASD, and
plot them on a single figure.

First, as always, we get the data using :meth:`TimeSeries.fetch_open_data`:


.. plot::
   :context: reset
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:

   from pydischarge.timeseries import TimeSeries
   hoft = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data('H1', 1187007040, 1187009088)

Next we calculate a :class:`~pydischarge.spectrogram.Spectrogram` by calculating
a number of ASDs, using the :meth:`~pydischarge.timeseries.TimeSeries.spectrogram2`
method:


.. plot::
   :context:
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:

   sg = hoft.spectrogram2(fftlength=4, overlap=2, window='hann') ** (1 / 2.)

From this we can trivially extract the median, 5th and 95th percentiles:


.. plot::
   :context:
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:

   median = sg.percentile(50)
   low = sg.percentile(5)
   high = sg.percentile(95)

Finally, we can make plot, using :meth:`~pydischarge.plot.Axes.plot_mmm` to
display the 5th and 95th percentiles as a shaded region around the median:


.. plot::
   :context:
   :include-source:

   from pydischarge.plot import Plot
   plot = Plot()
   ax = plot.add_subplot(
       xscale='log', xlim=(10, 1500), xlabel='Frequency [Hz]',
       yscale='log', ylim=(3e-24, 2e-20),
       ylabel=r'Strain noise [1/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$]',
   )
   ax.plot_mmm(median, low, high, color='pydischarge:ligo-hanford')
   ax.set_title('LIGO-Hanford strain noise variation around GW170817',
                fontsize=16)
   plot.show()

Now we can see that the ASD varies by factors of a few across most of the
frequency band, with notable exceptions, e.g. around the 60-Hz power line
harmonics (60 Hz, 120 Hz, 180 Hz, ...) where the noise is very stable.
